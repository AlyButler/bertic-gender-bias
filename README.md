Code and write-up for the paper "Evaluating Gender Bias in BERTić, a Large Language Model Trained on Croatian Data "

This project characterized and compared gender bias across three masked language models, BERT, mBERT, and BERTić, and two languages, English and Croatian, using the template sentence proposed in Kurita et al. (2019). In addition, the write-up explored the value of reducing or maintaining social bias in large language models fine-tuned for literary machine translation.
